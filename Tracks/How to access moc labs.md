### Environment Duration
Each Lab environment has two characteristics. Let us take a moment to understand them.<br><br>
• Course Environment Duration: Available as per the request for example user asked for AZ-900 for 3 month, in this case user can access the az-900 course all the anytime in those 3 months. Environment will get deleted after a specified months or days<br><br>
• Lab\Module Environment Duration: Environment will get deleted after a specified number of hours. E.g, Lab environment 1 duration is 2 Hours since it will be used for 2 to complete various lab modules. 

## Best Practices/ & Common Troubleshooting:

1. Stop the VM when not in use. Similarly Pause the SQL pool whenever it is not in use to optimize the azure cost.<br>
2. Bookmark your personalized lab URL to use throughout the workshop.<br>
3. If you face issue loading VM, please do the following:<br>
• Verify if VM is in running state from the Virtual Machines tab.<br>
• Try to open the environment URL in incognito/ private window.<br>
• Accept the cookies to the site (cloudlabs.ai)<br>
4. If you are unable to copy-paste from your device to inside the VM, it is probably due toclipboard access being disables. Please click on the SSL certificate symbol at the top left cornerin your browser and set clipboard to Allow. Once clipboard access is enabled, you can use CTRL+C to copy and CTRL+V to paste inside the VM. You can also try copying by right click > Copy on the selected content.<br>
